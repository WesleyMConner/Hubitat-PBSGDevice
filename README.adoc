= Pushbutton Switches

*Pushbutton Switches* functionality is a https://docs2.hubitat.com/developer/app/overview["_custom Hubitat Application_", window=read-ref,opts=”noopener,nofollow”] delivered in two components.

====
PushbuttonSwitches.groovy:: A Hubitat *Parent App* which DOES NOT enforce application behavior, but DOES collects child instances visually in the Hubitat GUI.

PushbuttonSwitchInstance.groovy:: A Hubitat *Child App* which implements core behavior - "_mutual exclusion_", "_default switch_" (optional).
====

== Mutual Exclusion
The primary focus of a *PushbuttonSwitchInstance* is to collect a group of devices (which implement the "_Switch_" capability, see https://docs2.hubitat.com/developer/driver/capability-list["Capability List", window=read-ref,opts=”noopener,nofollow”]) and ensure that only one device is "on" at a time.

.Pushbutton Switch Example
Old car radios are a great example of a simple pushbutton switch group. A single button is enabled at any one time. When a new station is enabled, all other stations are disabled.

.Mutual-Exclusion Example
Given::
* Four devices are added to a *PushButton Switch* instance, with initial state: +
`switch1` - _off_ +
`dimmer27` - _off_ +
`switch18` - _off_ +
`virtualSwitch2` - *on*
Event 0::
* `dimmer27` is turned "on" (_by whatever means_)
* The *Pushbutton Switch* instance enforces mutual exclusion.
* The resulting switch states are: +
`switch1` - _off_ +
`dimmer27` - *on* +
`switch18` - _off_ +
`virtualSwitch2` - _off_

== Default Switch Option
Optionally, a *PushButton Switch* instance can identify one participating switch as the *Default Switch*. If all switches in a *Pushbutton Switch* instance are turned "off", the *Default Switch* is automatically turned on.

.Default Switch Example
Given::
* Five devices are added to a *PushButton Switch* instance: +
`switch10`, `switch12`, `dimmer3`, `dimmer8` and `switch15`.
* `dimmer8` is selected as the *Default Switch*.
* Initially switch states are: +
`switch10` - _off_ +
`switch12` - *on* +
`dimmer3` - _off_ +
`dimmer8` (_default_) - _off_ +
`switch15` - _off_
Event 1::
* `switch10` is turned "on" (_by whatever means_)
* The *Pushbutton Switch* takes no automatic action.
* The resulting switch states are: +
`switch10` - *on* +
`switch12` - _off_ +
`dimmer3` - _off_ +
`dimmer8` (_default_) - _off_ +
`switch15` - _off_
Event 2::
* `switch10` is turned "off" (_by whatever means_)
* The *Pushbutton Switch* enables the *Default Switch*.
* The resulting switch states are: +
`switch10` - _off_ +
`switch12` - _off_ +
`dimmer3` - _off_ +
`dimmer8` (_default_) - *on* +
`switch15` - _off_

== Example Use Cases

=== Mode Selection using Virtual Switches
Hubitat Modes are mutual exclusive by their nature.

Modes can be adjusted externally (using Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, ...) by:

* Associating each mode with a *Hubitat Virtual Switch*
* Changing modes via the associated virtual switches exclusively.
* Using rules (or a *Pushbutton Switch* instance) to ensure a single mode switch is enabled at a time.
* Exposing the mode virtual switches externally.

=== Room Lighting Scene Selection
While the built-in *Room Lighting* application can facilitate per-room scene creation, it does not ensure a single scene is operating per room at any one time.

A per-room *Pushbutton Switch* instance can be used as the basis for developing mutually-exclusive per-room scenes.

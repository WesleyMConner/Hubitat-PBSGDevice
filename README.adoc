= PushButton Switch Group (PGSG)

A virtual *PushButtonSwitchGroup* (*PBSG*) device:

* Behaves like a keypad with multiple buttons, where:
** Only one button can be active at any time.
** An optional *default button* is activated if no other button is active.
* Each button has a corresponding *VswWithToggle* child devices.
* The state of the PBSG and its Child devices is continuously reconciled.
** PBSG methods include `activate(button)`, `deactivate(button)`, `push(buttonNumber)`.
** Child devices support `on()`, `off()` and `push()` | `toggle()`.

== What is a PBSG?

A PBSG is a Hubitat-compatible virtual device where ...

=== The client provides ...

buttons `(required)`::
A list of button names.

defaultButton `(optional)`::
A button (from the buttons list) that becomes active if no other PBSG button is active.

=== The virtual device ensures...

* Only one button is active at any time.
* The defaultButton (if specified) is activated when no other button is active.
* One child VSW exists per button.
* Child VSW state is updated when the PBSG state changes.
* PBSG state is updated when child VSWs are turned on or off.

=== Advanced device features include ...

* A companion demonstration application that illustrates device creation AND facilitates automatically-generated test scripts.
* A custom dashboard cell (FUTURE)

== Why use a PBSG?

* A PBSG realizes a mutually-exclusive collection of buttons and corresponding switches.
* Use cases include: Managing Hubitat modes, Managing per-room scenes, etc.
* The PBSG can support Hubitat's `pushable` interface and concurrently facilitate Alexa integration (which is limited to turn on / turn off).

== How are PBSGs defined?

The structure of a PBSG can be defined:

. Using the device drilldown page in the Hubitat GUI.
. In code using available API calls.

=== OVERVIEW
.Conceptually, a PBSG has:
[width="100%", frame="none", grid="none", cols=">15h,<85"]
|===
|buttons |An ArrayList of all the buttons managed by the PBSG
|active |The button that is currently 'on' +
(can be null if there is no dflt button)
|dflt |The button that is turned 'on' if active becomes null +
(can be 'not_applicable')
|lifo |
The list of 'off' buttons where the most recently +
turned off button is the "last in" - facilitating the "activateLastActive" command.

== USAGE OF CONCURRENT HASH MAP

=== Competition for PBSG static data
* Manual update via Hubitat UI
* Programmatic update via config()

=== Competition for PBSG dynamic data
* Requests on the PBSG itself (from the parent, from events)
* Actions on the VSWs (fielded by the parent)

=== Reboot Challenges
* No entries survive a hub reboot; so, state must be rebuilt.
* Each PBSG has a Concurrent State Map (csm) stored in perPbsgState
at key device.idAsLong.
** Concurrency extends to operations on this inner Map.
** To abbreviate 'concurrentState', 'ccs' is used.
** Treatment wrt the following is TBD:

NOTE: The ConcurrentHashMap `perPbsgState` is used in lieu of `state` or `atomicState`.
